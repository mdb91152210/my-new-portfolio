import CodeGroup from '@/components/mdx/CodeGroup';
import { QuickView } from '@/components/mdx/Link';

After working with several web technologies, I decided to build my own **full stack portfolio website** using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**.  
These tools completely changed how I approach web development — from performance to design workflow.

This post is a quick overview of my experience after using these technologies for a few months and why I’d continue using them for future projects.

## ⚡ Next.js

Before this project, I was using plain React or CRA (Create React App) for most of my work.  
Switching to **Next.js** made development faster, more organized, and much easier to deploy.

What I loved about it:

### 1. **Built-in Routing**

No need for `react-router-dom` — Next.js provides file-based routing automatically.  
Creating dynamic pages like blog posts or project details is effortless.

I also liked **API Routes** — they let me build serverless functions directly in the app without using Express.js.  
That’s how I added dynamic features like views and contact form handling.

### 2. **Markdown (MDX) Support**

Since my portfolio uses MDX for blog content, integrating `@next/mdx` made it super easy to write posts that include custom React components right inside markdown.

### 3. **Optimization**

Next.js automatically optimizes fonts and images.  
I used the built-in **Image component** for lazy loading and responsive optimization, and it handled everything for me.

In short, it’s React — but way more powerful and production-ready.

## 🎨 Tailwind CSS

At first, I was skeptical about Tailwind CSS.  
It looked messy to have so many utility classes inside HTML — but once I tried it, I understood why it’s so popular.

Tailwind completely changed how I write styles.

### ✅ What I love about it:

- **Faster workflow:** I can style directly inside JSX — no switching files or naming CSS classes.
- **Responsive and dark mode ready:** Tailwind has built-in responsive utilities and `dark:` variants.
- **Utility-based simplicity:** No need to remember long CSS rules — just use small, predictable utility classes.
- **Small bundle size:** Only the classes I use are included in the final CSS file.
- **Perfect for UI consistency:** Once you build a design system, keeping the entire site consistent becomes easy.

Example:

```html
<div class="rounded-lg px-4 py-2 font-semibold text-black dark:text-white">
  Hello World
</div>
```
