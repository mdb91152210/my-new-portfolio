Creating my personal portfolio website has been one of the most exciting projects I’ve worked on as a Full Stack Developer. It not only showcases my skills and experience but also represents my design thinking and technical ability to build clean, responsive, and dynamic web applications.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

I wanted my portfolio to be **simple, fast, and modern** — a place where I could share my journey, highlight projects, and make it easy for recruiters and collaborators to connect with me.  
The website was built using **Next.js**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**, deployed on **Vercel**, and connected to **MongoDB** for data management.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

Here’s the stack I used to bring everything together:

- **Frontend:** React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js with API routes in Next.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (using Prisma ORM)
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

This combination allowed me to build a smooth, scalable, and SEO-friendly portfolio with minimal configuration.

---

## ⚙️ Features

My portfolio includes several features I’m proud of:

- **Dynamic Project Section:** Each project is automatically listed from MDX content files.
- **Contact Page:** Integrated with MongoDB to manage and store inquiries.
- **Dark & Light Mode:** Implemented using `next-themes`.
- **Responsive Design:** Works perfectly across devices using Tailwind’s utility classes.
- **Animation:** Added motion effects with Framer Motion for a smooth, modern UI feel.

## 🧩 Challenges and Learning

One of the most interesting parts was setting up database integration with Prisma and MongoDB on Vercel.  
Ensuring environment variables and schema generation worked correctly between local and deployed environments taught me a lot about **deployment workflows** and **environment configurations**.

I also learned to optimize performance by leveraging Next.js’s **Image Optimization** and **Static Site Generation (SSG)** to improve load times.

---

## 🚀 Deployment and Hosting

I chose **Vercel** because it integrates seamlessly with GitHub.  
Every time I push code to the main branch, Vercel automatically rebuilds and redeploys the latest version of my portfolio — making it effortless to keep my site up to date.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me sharpen my full stack development skills, especially around:

- Structuring and organizing a modern Next.js project.
- Managing state and animations efficiently in React.
- Using Tailwind CSS to quickly prototype and refine designs.
- Integrating MongoDB with Prisma for database operations.

## ✨ Conclusion

Building this portfolio was more than just a coding exercise — it was a creative expression of who I am as a developer.  
It reflects my attention to detail, my passion for UI/UX, and my commitment to continuous learning.
