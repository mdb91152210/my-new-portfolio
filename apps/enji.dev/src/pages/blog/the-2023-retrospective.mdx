Happy New Year 2024!  
As I look back on 2023, I can confidently say — it was a year full of challenges, progress, and achievements in my journey as a **Full Stack Developer**.

---

## 🎯 Year in Review

2023 was all about growth — improving my technical skills, gaining real-world experience, and pushing myself into new opportunities.

At the start of the year, I set several goals:

- Build my **portfolio website** and keep improving it.
- Work on **real-world projects** and strengthen my full stack knowledge.
- Complete an **internship in web development**.
- Learn to manage my time better while balancing college and projects.
- Keep building a strong developer mindset.

Looking back, I’m proud to say that I accomplished almost all of them 🎉

## 💼 Internship at Femtosoft Technologies

One of the biggest milestones of 2023 was completing my **Full Stack Developer internship** at **Femtosoft Technologies** (June 30 – July 30, 2025).

This experience gave me the opportunity to work on real-world projects, collaborate with a development team, and understand how to bring a complete web solution from idea to deployment.

I learned to work with:

- **React.js** and **Next.js** for front-end development
- **MongoDB** for database management
- **Node.js** and **Express.js** for backend APIs
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and teamwork

It helped me grow from a student developer into a confident professional capable of handling full-stack workflows.

## 🌐 Building My Portfolio Website

Another key achievement was designing and building my **personal portfolio website** from scratch.

The project allowed me to combine creativity with technical skills — using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion** to deliver a modern, interactive design.

What made this project special is that it wasn’t just a static website — it included real data tracking, dynamic pages, and integration with **MongoDB**.

It’s now deployed live using **Vercel**, and I keep updating it as I learn new things.

## 🧠 New Skills Unlocked

Throughout 2023, I expanded my skill set beyond what I initially planned.

Here are the highlights:

- Learned **React Hooks**, **Next.js 13 App Router**, and **API Routes**
- Explored **Framer Motion** for UI animations
- Practiced **database design** using **Prisma** and **MongoDB Atlas**
- Mastered **Git workflows** and collaborative version control
- Built multiple side projects for practice

Each new project taught me something different — from UI responsiveness to API security and cloud deployment.

## 🧩 Certifications & Achievements

In 2023, I also earned certifications that strengthened my technical foundation:

- 🧑‍💻 **Web Development Certificate** from **Acme Grade** (Sept 9 – Oct 9, 2025)
- ⚙️ **RPA Foundation Course** by **UiPath & Nanmudhalvan**
- Completed **Full Stack Internship** at **Femtosoft Technologies**

Each of these helped me gain practical experience and confidence in the field.

## 💻 Personal Growth

One of my biggest personal learnings this year was consistency.

Balancing college, internships, and side projects taught me the value of time management and focus.  
I learned that small, consistent steps every day lead to big improvements over time.

This year also taught me how to communicate better, manage feedback, and take responsibility for my work — especially when collaborating on technical projects.

## 🚀 What’s Next for 2024

My focus for 2024 is to take everything I learned in 2023 and push it further:

- Build **a SaaS product** or real-world web app
- Learn **TypeScript** and **Advanced Next.js concepts**
- Improve UI/UX design knowledge
- Contribute to open-source projects on GitHub
- Stay active on LinkedIn and share development insights

I’m excited for the opportunities ahead and ready to keep growing as a developer and creator. 💪
